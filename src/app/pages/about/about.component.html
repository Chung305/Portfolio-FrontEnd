        <h3>Background</h3>

            Originally from Miami where I graduated from Miami Beach Senior High. After high school,
            I picked up Djing as a hobby with my two other cousins Federico and Robert. I immediately
            fell in love with it and the tools used to mix music such as CDJs 2000 and Allen Heath Xone: 92
            (rotary level controls). I eventually moved to Delaware with my brother Alex and realized I
            wanted to pursue something with technology but wasnâ€™t sure what to study, so I chose computer science.
            While taking computer science classes I again, fell in love. I found a passion and found myself
            really eager to keep learning different technologies. Using my creativity, attention to detail and
            dedication to write code, but at the time I had no idea or understood how clouds worked or how front-end
            and back-end worked together. At the same time, I was working as a chef in a couple locations. Sadly,
            with financial problems I stopped going to school to find another job. Working two jobs for a year and
            wanting to keep pursuing technology I discovered Zipcode Wilmington which is a 12-week immersive bootcamp.
            Having nothing to lose, I took a chance.
